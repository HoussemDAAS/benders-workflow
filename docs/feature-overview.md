# Feature Overview and Future Plans

This document provides an overview of the current features of the Benders-Workflow application and outlines potential plans for future development.

## Core Features

### 1. Dashboard

-   **Overview**: The dashboard serves as the central hub, providing a high-level overview of all activities. It includes statistics on clients, workflows, tasks, and team members. Key widgets display recent activity, task distribution by status, workflow progress, team workload, and upcoming deadlines.
-   **Future Plans**:
    -   **Customizable Dashboards**: Allow users to rearrange, add, or remove widgets to create a personalized view.
    -   **User-Specific Views**: Tailor the dashboard content based on the logged-in user's role and assignments.
    -   **Deeper Analytics**: Introduce more advanced performance metrics and historical data charts.

### 2. Client Management

-   **Overview**: A comprehensive module to manage all client information. Users can perform full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on clients. Each client profile provides a consolidated view of their associated workflows, tasks, and meetings.
-   **Future Plans**:
    -   **Custom Fields**: Allow adding custom fields to client profiles to store domain-specific information.
    -   **Contact & Communication Logging**: Integrate a system for logging calls, emails, and other interactions with clients.
    -   **CRM Integration**: Explore possibilities for integrating with popular CRM systems.

### 3. Workflow & Task Management (Kanban System)

-   **Overview**: The core of the application is a Kanban-based task management system. While initially conceived with a more complex workflow visualization, the system has pivoted to use workflows as high-level projects or containers for tasks. The Kanban board allows for intuitive task management with features like status updates, priority levels, due dates, and team member assignments.
-   **Future Plans**:
    -   **Advanced Kanban Features**: Implement Work-In-Progress (WIP) limits, swimlanes (e.g., by team member or priority), and card aging.
    -   **Task Dependencies**: Introduce the ability to set dependencies between tasks (e.g., "blocker" or "waiting on").
    -   **Time Tracking**: Add functionality for team members to log time spent on tasks.
    -   **Calendar View**: Provide a calendar view for tasks with due dates.
    -   **Automation Rules**: Allow users to create simple automation rules (e.g., "when a task is moved to 'Done', send a notification to the project manager").

### 4. Team Management

-   **Overview**: This feature allows for managing team members, including their roles, skills, and contact information. The system provides insights into each member's current workload and assignments across different projects.
-   **Future Plans**:
    -   **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Implement a robust permission system to control access to different features and data based on user roles.
    -   **Team Performance Analytics**: Develop reports to track team productivity and performance over time.
    -   **Capacity Planning**: Create tools to help project managers plan and allocate resources based on team capacity.

### 5. Meeting Management

-   **Overview**: A simple but effective tool for scheduling and tracking meetings with clients. It allows for adding attendees, setting the date and location, and tracking the meeting's status.
-   **Future Plans**:
    -   **Calendar Integration**: Sync meetings with external calendars like Google Calendar or Outlook.
    -   **Automated Reminders**: Send automatic email or in-app reminders to attendees before a meeting.
    -   **Meeting Minutes**: Add a feature for taking and sharing meeting minutes directly within the application.

## General & Architectural Plans

-   **Real-time Updates**: Implement WebSockets to provide real-time updates across the application (e.g., moving a task on the Kanban board should be instantly visible to all team members).
-   **Enhanced Notifications**: Build a more comprehensive in-app and email notification system.
-   **Global Search**: Introduce a powerful global search functionality to quickly find clients, tasks, meetings, etc.
-   **Improved Mobile Responsiveness**: Continue to enhance the application's design for a seamless experience on mobile and tablet devices.
